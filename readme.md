img3 = cv.polylines(img3, [np.int32(dst)], True, (0, 0, 255), 3, cv.LINE_AA): This line draws a polygon (specifically, a closed polyline) around the corresponding keypoints in img3. The polygon is defined by the variable dst, which is a list of coordinates that represent the endpoints of the polygon's sides. The np.int32() function is used to convert the coordinates to integers (which is required by the cv.polylines() function). The polygon is drawn in red (i.e., (0, 0, 255)), with a thickness of 3 pixels, and using anti-aliased lines (cv.LINE_AA). The resulting image is stored back in img3.
